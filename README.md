First You need to install Node.js and mongodb.

You need to run the mongodb by following the steps given in the following link - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

after the mongoDb has been installed we can check the connection from our server side by mongoose.connection()
after the server is up and running we need to install the angular cli using the command - npm install -g @angualr/cli.

to create new project use ng new project-name.
after the project is created, create the components and then run it using npm start.

then go to browser open localhost:4200 and your app will be running.
